# How to Identify UBI Base Images
In the past, there was a scenario where we needed to determine if over 100 container images were Red Hat UBI-based or third-party images. To check if there were any non-UBI images, such as third-party images used in Telco CNFs stored on a Red Hat private Quay registry server, we had to manually inspect each image or use tools to do so. This was a time-consuming process, taking several minutes for each image. To simplify and streamline the process, I created a knowledge base using shell script and REST API to identify the images and output the results in a CSV file or on the screen, reducing the time to just 2-3 minutes for 100 images.
